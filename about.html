  <p>Ah, the standard about page. What to say about myself...</p>
	
 <p>Well, like most  of the Petz Community I started playing Dogz 3 back when I was a kid but I can't remember exactly what year at this pont. The game was released in 1998 so that's what I'm going with. Of course I was instantly hooked by the game and it wasn't long before I discovered a number of Petz websites created by other players, and I absolutely had to build my own.</p>
 
 <p>I think I used every web building site that existed at the time, from Angelfire to Crosswinds to Homestead, etc. etc. I don't remember what my websites were called, and none of them became very popular. But I loved the creative work of building the sites, even if nobody saw them, and I can't believe that at such a young age I was dabbling in what would eventually become a seriously sought-after skill! I honestly wish that I had stuck with coding as I got older, but that was not in the cards for me. At some point I started middle school and then high school and with that I lost interest in Dogz and web building, and so my websites were either deleted or left behind to die in cyberspace with other abandoned websites.</p>
 
 <p>It wasn't until recently that I started grad school and my degree program requires coursework in technology and coding and whatnot, and I started learning about the newer languages that evolved from HTML. I excelled in these courses I think in part because of my background with HTML and web design, and I became curious about what I could still accomplish with whatever knowledge I had left. I figured out how to build a static HTML page with <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, then use <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> to deploy the website with a URL. Et voila! I'm back in business with my own Petz website. I intentionally went with a sort of old-school look, especially with the static HTML code as opposed to something more updated, like PHP or whatever the heck else developers use these days. I wanted to pay homage to the cheesey little websites I used to make. &#128579;</p>
 
 <p>I don't really know where I plan to go with this. Overall I think this website will serve as a little experiment for myself, to not only recall my old knowledge but to also build upon that knowledge and learn new things. Example: I completely forgot that to create spaces with HTML, we use the code "&amp;nbsp;" and as soon as I looked it up, I was reminded of a little jingle I had in my head as a kid to help me remember it. And a new thing that I learned: CSS stylesheets! I was totally intimidated by CSS as a kid, but now I realize how easy and more effective it is to have an external CSS stylsheet, rather than tediously recoding each page every time I want to change a display element. I guess when I was a kid I had all the time in the world to manually update each page, whereas my adult life doesn't really allow for that kind of time commitment anymore! &#128516;</p>

          <p>Bemo is my real-life cat who I've had for eight years now. I found him in the middle of the night when he was just a tiny kitten -- he was only about four weeks old! While walking home I heard the unmistakable sound of a kitten crying in a nearby group of bushes. My friend ventured into the bushes and emerged with a little floof that fit in my hands! We stopped at 7-11 to buy cat food, and I vowed to keep the kitten overnight and bring him to the SPCA the next morning. Well, the little kitten snuggled up in bed with me and started purring and that was it: he was mine.</p>
          
          <p>I created a list of probably over fifteen names but just couldn't decide on one. But I kept calling the kitten "little beast monster" because he would run around all the time and attack my feet! I thought about how I could turn those words into a name, and came up with Bemo -- a combination of the words Beast Monster. Bemo also happens to be a different spelling of the name BMO, who is a character from a cartoon show that I love called Adventure Time. As soon as I made that connection, Bemo's name was decided!</p>
          <p>Bemo quickly grew into the giant fluff that he is now, and is probably the sweetest cat I've ever had. He still regularly surprises me with new quirks and funny antics. He loves his belly rubbed and will actually roll over onto his back and raise his arms to allow for prime belly scritches. Like many cats, he rarely shows interest in toys that I've purchased for him but will endlessly chase rubberbands and rolled-up pieces of paper. He's a little spoiled and I admit to giving him human food sometimes -- cheese is is favorite. Bemo and I have been through a lot over the years and I don't know what I would have done without him.</p>
