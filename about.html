  <p>Ah, the standard about page. What to say about myself...</p>
	
 <p>Well, like most  of the Petz Community I started playing Dogz 3 back when I was a kid but I can't remember exactly what year at this pont. The game was released in 1998 so that's what I'm going with. Of course I was instantly hooked by the game and it wasn't long before I discovered a number of Petz websites created by other players, and I absolutely had to build my own.</p>
 
 <p>I think I used every web building site that existed at the time, from Angelfire to Crosswinds to Homestead, etc. etc. I don't remember what my websites were called, and none of them became very popular. But I loved the creative work of building the sites, even if nobody saw them, and I can't believe that at such a young age I was dabbling in what would eventually become a seriously sought-after skill! I honestly wish that I had stuck with coding as I got older, but that was not in the cards for me. At some point I started middle school and then high school and with that I lost interest in Dogz and web building, and so my websites were either deleted or left behind to die in cyberspace with other abandoned websites.</p>
 
 <p>It wasn't until recently that I started grad school and my degree program requires coursework in technology and coding and whatnot, and I started learning about the newer languages that evolved from HTML. I excelled in these courses I think in part because of my background with HTML and web design, and I became curious about what I could still accomplish with my old-school knowledge. I figured out how to build a static HTML page with <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, then use <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> to deploy the website with a URL. Et voila! I'm back in business with my own Petz website. I intentionally went with a sort of old-school look, especially with the static HTML code as opposed to something more updated, like PHP or whatever the heck else developers use these days. I wanted to pay homage to the cheesey little websites I used to make. &#128579;</p>
 
 <p>I don't really know where I plan to go with this. Overall I think this website will serve as a little experiment for myself, to not only recall my old knowledge but to also build upon that knowledge and learn new things. Example: I completely forgot that to create spaces with HTML, we use the code "&amp;nbsp;" and as soon as I looked it up, I was reminded of a little jingle I had in my head as a kid to help me remember it. And a new thing that I learned: CSS stylesheets! I was totally intimidated by CSS as a kid, but now I realize how easy and more effective it is to have an external CSS stylsheet, rather than tediously recoding each page every time I want to change a display element. I guess when I was a kid I had all the time in the world to manually update each page, whereas my adult life doesn't really allow for that kind of time commitment anymore! &#128516;</p>
