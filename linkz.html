  <p>Here I'd like to share some notable links and websites that have inspired or otherwise impacted my involvement in the Petz Community.</p>

  <p>I recently found these two articles and was inspired to create a new Petz website:</p>
		<ul>
      <li><a href"https://www.themarysue.com/petz-subculture-women/" target="_blank">Lost to Time: Gamingâ€™s Forgotten Petz Subculture and the Women Who Shaped It</a>
      </li>
			<li><a href="https://medium.com/@melissamcewen/petz-a-lost-community-of-mostly-female-coders-gamers-2eb0e1a73f42" target="_blank">Petz: A lost community of mostly female coders/gamers</a>
