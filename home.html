  <p><marquee>Welcome to my Petz website! This site is brand new and still a work in progress.</marquee></p>
  <p>I am so glad that the Petz Community is kind of seeing a revival! After reading a couple of articles about the formation of the community back in the 90s, I was inspired to break out the ol' HTML skills which have been sitting in dormany for about twenty years now. I'm still re-learning over here and a LOT has changed since I was a kid, but I'm hoping to have fun with it and keep expanding my knowledge of web design.</p>
